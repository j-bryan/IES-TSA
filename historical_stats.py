TODO: I want to run stuff like Breusch-Pagan here.

Breusch-Pagan shouldn't be run in the other analysis, as the test should be applied specifically to the historical data.
Also, I'll have to use my own detrending and normalization code for this, since we need to apply the test to the normalized
residual. RAVEN can't provide that.

TODO: Add my code from Google Drive that has this already
